# **Leveraging DenseNet Features for Machine Learning-Based Lung Disease Diagnosis From X-Rays**  
### **An Automated Deep Learning System for Lung Disease Classification**  

## **Overview**  
This project presents an **automated lung disease diagnosis system** using **DenseNet feature extraction** and **machine learning classifiers** to classify **bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal cases** from chest X-ray (CXR) images.  

By leveraging the power of **DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, and DenseNet-201**, the model extracts deep features and enhances classification performance using **SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Random Forest** classifiers. The **DenseNet-201 + SVM model** achieved the highest test accuracy of **97.67%**, proving its effectiveness in assisting radiologists with clinical diagnosis.  

## **Key Features**  
âœ” Utilizes **DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, and DenseNet-201** for feature extraction.  
âœ” Integrates **machine learning classifiers (SVM, Random Forest)** for enhanced diagnosis.  
âœ” Achieves **94.10% accuracy** with DenseNet-201 and **97.67% accuracy** with SVM.  
âœ” Employs **feature extraction from penultimate layers** for improved classification.  
âœ” Works with a dataset of **4,202 CXR images** for robust model training.
