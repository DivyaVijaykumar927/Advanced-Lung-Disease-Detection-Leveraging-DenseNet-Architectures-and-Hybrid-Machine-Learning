# Advanced-Lung-Disease-Detection-Leveraging-DenseNet-Architectures-and-Hybrid-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building an automated system to classify lung diseases from chest X-ray (CXR) images. Utilizing various DenseNet models, the system effectively identifies four distinct categories: bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal conditions. Key features of the project include.
Feature extraction from DenseNet models integrated with traditional classifiers (SVM, Random Forest) enhanced accuracy.
